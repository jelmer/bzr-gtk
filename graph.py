    """Produce a directed graph of a bzr branch.

    Traverses the branch revision tree starting at start and produces an
    ordered list of revisions such that a revision always comes after
    any revision it is the parent of.  It also tries to make a reasonably
    not-too-stupid decision whether a parent revision is on the same
    logical branch, as that information is not available with bzr.

    For each revision it then yields a tuple of (revision, node, lines).
    If the revision is only referenced in the branch and not present in the
    store, revision will be a DummyRevision object, otherwise it is the bzr
    Revision object with the meta-data for the revision.

    Node is a tuple of (column, colour) with column being a zero-indexed
    column number of the graph that this revision represents and colour
    being a zero-indexed colour (which doesn't specify any actual colour
    in particular) to draw the node in.

    Lines is a list of tuples which represent lines you should draw away
    from the revision, if you also need to draw lines into the revision
    you should use the lines list from the previous iteration.  Each
    typle in the list is in the form (start, end, colour) with start and
    end being zero-indexed column numbers and colour as in node.

    It's up to you how to actually draw the nodes and lines (straight,
    curved, kinked, etc.) and to pick the actual colours for each index.
