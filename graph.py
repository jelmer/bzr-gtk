    column number of the graph that this revision represents and colour
    being a zero-indexed colour (which doesn't specify any actual colour

    from the revision, if you also need to draw lines into the revision
    you should use the lines list from the previous iteration.  Each
    typle in the list is in the form (start, end, colour) with start and
    end being zero-indexed column numbers and colour as in node.
