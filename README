                            gannotate - bzr plugin
                            ======================

gannotate is a GTK+ annotation plugin for bazaar-NG.

The commit log message is shown in the lower window pane for the selected
line.  The line number column is searchable; jump to a specific line by typing
the line number while the annotation pane is in focus.

By default, lines are highlighted according to age. This functionality is a
crib of emacs' VC-annotate highlighting, and thus works similarly: blue is
oldest and red is youngest, and an assortment of other colors in-between:

        blue --> green --> yellow --> orange --> red

Time spans are scaled; for instance by selecting "1 Day", lines older than a
day will be highlighted blue, but changes in the past hour will be red and
lines 2 hours old may be orange. Highlighting can be turned off with --plain
if overwhelming.
