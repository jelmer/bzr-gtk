===================================

This is a plugin for bzr that allows you to see the history of a branch
and relationships between the revisions visually.

need the following runtime dependencies:

  * Python 2.4
  * bzr 0.1 or later
  * PyGTK 2.8 or later
  * PyCairo 1.0 or later


Installation
------------

The easiest way to install bzrk is to either copy or symlink the
directory into your ~/.bazaar/plugins directory.

Other ways include doing the same in the bzrlib/plugins directory of
your bzr working tree, or adding the location of bzrk to your
