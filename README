bzrk - visualisation plugin for bzr
===================================

This is a plugin for bzr that allows you to see the history of a branch
and relationships between the revisions visually.


Dependencies
------------

bzrk is written in Python, so doesn't need compiling, however you will
need the following runtime dependencies:

  * Python 2.4
  * bzr 0.6 or later
  * PyGTK 2.8 or later
  * PyCairo 1.0 or later


Installation
------------

The easiest way to install bzrk is to either copy or symlink the
directory into your ~/.bazaar/plugins directory.

Other ways include doing the same in the bzrlib/plugins directory of
your bzr working tree, or adding the location of bzrk to your
BZR_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable.


Usage
-----

Simply run "bzr visualise" (or "bzr viz") while in a bzr working tree,
a window will appear with the history of the branch and a graph
connecting the individual revisions.

You can move through the revision history by clicking or with the arrow
keys.  You can also use the Back (shortcut '[') and Forward (shortcut ']')
buttons which move to the previous and next revision from that selected
(which may not be immediately adjacent in the list).

Details for the selected revision are shown in the pane at the bottom,
including the ids of the parent revisions.  Clicking on the go icon next
to a parent moves the list to that revision; clicking on the view icon
opens a window to display the difference between the two revisions.
