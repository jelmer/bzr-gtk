Nautilus plugin for bzr
=======================

This tool, written by Jelmer Vernooij and Jeff Bailey presents
menu options when working in a bzr tree.

To use this, either place the nautilus-bzr.py file in
~/.nautilus/python-extensions or in /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-1.0/python

If on an Ubuntu system, you must install python-nautilus.  This package
assumes bzr 0.8.  After installation, restart nautilus.

A lot of functionality requires the 'bzr-gtk' plugin for Bazaar to be installed.
