TODO list for Olive
-------------------

- Use networkmanager to figure out whether to do local or bound commits  
  in case of bound branches/checkouts.
- Strict commit should not be a checkbox. The GUI should rather ask the 
  user whether (s)he wants to continue if there were no changes.
- Commit with unknowns should not be a checkbox. The GUI should rather ask 
  the user whether (s)he wants to continue while there were unknown files.
- It should be possible to add unknown files from the commit dialog.
- Generic wrapper that displays dialogs for bzr exceptions
