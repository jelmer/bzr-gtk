TODO list for Olive
-------------------

- Use networkmanager to figure out whether to do local or bound commits  
  in case of bound branches/checkouts.
- Strict commit should not be a checkbox. The GUI should rather ask the 
  user whether (s)he wants to continue if there were no changes.
- Commit with unknowns should not be a checkbox. The GUI should rather ask 
  the user whether (s)he wants to continue while there were unknown files.
- It should be possible to add unknown files from the commit dialog.
- Generic wrapper that displays dialogs for bzr exceptions
- Store list of previously seen branch locations and list them in 
  a combo box in the "branch location" field in the get branch window
- Allow selecting a particular revision (actually browsing the revisions 
  rather than specifying a particular revno) in the get branch window
- Eliminate radiobuttons in push but rather show the default location and 
  allow the user to change it
- Don't have an overwrite checkbox but instead ask the user if (s)he wants 
  to overwrite if the branches have diverged
- Remove the status window as it's pointless since the status is already shown
  in the main window.
- Is there any reason why on win32 bzr branches have to be on fixed drives and 
  not on, e.g., cdroms?
