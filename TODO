TODO list for Bzr-Gtk
---------------------

- List unknown files in commit dialog
- Allow merging revisions from missing dialog
- It should be possible to add unknown files from the commit dialog.
- Eliminate radiobuttons in push but rather show the default location and 
  allow the user to change it
- Remove the status window as it's pointless since the status is already shown
  in the main window.
- Is there any reason why on win32 bzr branches have to be on fixed drives and 
  not on, e.g., cdroms?
- Dialog for applying a bundle
- Switch dialog
- Ability to bind/unbind the branch
- List Bzr options in context menu in a way that makes sense (alphabetically?)
- Allow specifying two revisions in the diff window rather then always diffing between base and working tree
- For performance BranchDialog should only open each url once. Once opened it
  should keep a read lock open and only release this when the url is changed.
  It should also allow the creator of the window to supply an already opened
  branch, and a revision id.
