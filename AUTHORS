bzr-gtk is a plugin that is based on a collection of earlier plugins for 
Bazaar. It is currently maintained by Jelmer Vernooij <jelmer@samba.org>.

bzrk was written by Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>. 

It's vaguely based on a screenshot of gitk (the equivalent tool for git)
shown to me by Fabio M. Di Nitto <fabbione@ubuntu.com>.

gannotate was written by Dan Loda <danloda@gmail.com> and later maintained 
by Aaron Bentley <abentley@panoramicfeedback.com>.
